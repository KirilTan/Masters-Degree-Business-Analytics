# Methods and Algorithms for Business Analytics on Big Data

## 📘 Course Overview
This repository contains structured learning materials, implementations, and notes for the master's-level course **"Methods and Algorithms for Business Analytics on Big Data"**, part of the program *Modeling Big Data in Business and Finance* at Sofia University *St. Kliment Ohridski*.

The course focuses on:
- understanding **Big Data concepts and lifecycle**
- applying **statistical and machine learning methods** for business analytics
- building **predictive and classification models**
- linking analytical results to **real business decision-making**

The repository is designed to be:
- ✅ exam-oriented
- ✅ learning-oriented
- ✅ reusable as a professional portfolio

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By working through this repository, the goal is to:
- Understand what makes data *"big"* and why traditional methods fail
- Learn how to transform raw, unstructured data into structured datasets
- Apply regression, classification, and clustering methods
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g. R², accuracy)
- Connect analytics outputs to **business processes and decisions**

---

## 🧠 Course Context & Methodology
The course follows the **Big Data Analytics lifecycle**:
1. Data Generation
2. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing
3. Data Storage
4. Data Analytics (statistical & machine learning methods)
5. Data Visualization & Interpretation

Analytics techniques covered include:
- **Descriptive Analytics** – what happened?
- **Predictive Analytics** – what will happen?
- **Prescriptive Analytics** – what should we do?

Special emphasis is placed on **business applications** such as:
- Business Process Management (BPM)
- Human Resources Analytics
- Telecommunications and customer analytics

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
The course uses a **fixed and reproducible environment** as required by the lecturer:
- Python **3.7** (Anaconda distribution)
- Core libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

Although newer tools exist, consistency and methodological understanding are prioritized.

## 📘 How to Use This Repository
- Start with **theory/** to understand concepts
- Use **notebooks/** to see methods applied step-by-step
- Refer to **scripts/** for clean algorithm implementations
- Check **resources/** for original course materials
- Use **datasets/** together with notebooks and scripts

This separation mirrors how analytics is done in real projects: understanding → experimentation → implementation → decision support.
